      <h2>The Man Behind the Screen</h2>

        <dt><strong>Who is SKIBZ?</strong></dt>
        <dd>My real name is Skyler Roberson. I am a full-time student at Northwest Missouri State University.
          I'm currently studying Business Technology while pursuing a minor in Digital Media. I've always been
          an avid NFL and NBA fan, and follow both of them closely. I love getting outside and going on hikes,
          and enjoying the outdoors.</dd>
        <dt><strong>How did you get into video games?</strong></dt>
        <dd>I started playing video games around the age of five with my older cousins. They used to always demolish
          me, but I still had fun playing. Eventually I got a GameCube, yes, you read that right, and have been playing
          ever since. I have since upgraded, and now play on Playstation!</dd>
        <dt><strong>Who do you play with?</strong></dt>
        <dd>I usually play with my friends from either high school or here at college. I also have multiple family
          members that I play with, so it is always a good time in the chat.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Why do you like to play video games?</strong></dt>
        <dd>I like to play video games because it gives you a chance to interact and do things with people that may
          not live close to you, which is a huge bonus while in college.
          Rather than talking on the phone, you can talk while playing video games, which is
          way more fun anyways! I also just love the competitiveness that comes along with playing as well.</dd>
