      <h2>My Favorite Games to Play</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Call of Duty</strong></dt>
        <dd>I play many different games, some simulation, and some arcade and story-based games. However, most
          of my time is on Call of Duty. I usually either play Warzone or Vanguard with friends. Although sometimes
          the game makes me want to pull my hair out, I still enjoy the thrill of it. I am not the best player in the
          world, nor do I claim to be, but it sure is fun!</dd>
        <dt><strong>NBA 2K</strong></dt>
        <dd>NBA 2K was one of the first games that I ever personally bought and played. As I was formerly a basketball
          player, it makes sense. I've always loved playing against other people in "my sport" virtually, because I
          feel like I have at least a small advantage. During this year's release, I mainly play in the Rec with my
          Cousin and some of his friends. For the upcoming release, I plan to join a Pro-AM team and try to make some
          money playing.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Grand Theft Auto 5</strong></dt>
        <dd>I didn't really want to be specific on the titles, but considering that this game has been out for nine
          years, and there's still no new release, I feel obligated to. GTA 5 is one of the weirdest, challenging, yet
          fun games that I've ever played. I recently started getting back into it, and I'm currently having quite a bit
          of fun!</dd>
