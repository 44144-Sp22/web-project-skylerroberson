    <h2>Bringing Video Game Fans Together</h2>
    <p><span class="name">SKIBZ GAMING</span> was created to build a portfolio of the part of myself that
      loves playing video games. I wanted to build a space where fellow gamers could connect, reach out, and possibly
      even play with me on stream, helping to build their portfolio as well. I hope you enjoy this experience.
      A few of my favorite recent gaming clips are included if you click on the "SKIBZ" logo below!.</p>
